Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm is an efficient algorithm used in computer graphics to draw a straight line between two points on a raster screen using only integer arithmetic. Because of this, it is very fast and widely used in graphics hardware.


Why Bresenham’s Algorithm is needed

A screen is made of pixels (discrete points).

A mathematical line is continuous, so we must choose the closest pixel to represent the line.

Floating-point calculations are slow.

Bresenham’s algorithm avoids floating point and uses decision parameters to select pixels.

Basic idea

For a line from point (x₀, y₀) to (x₁, y₁):

At each step, decide which pixel is closer to the ideal line

Choose between two candidate pixels

Use a decision variable to make this choice
---

Assumptions (standard case)

Slope 0 ≤ m ≤ 1

Line is drawn from left to right

If slope > 1, x and y roles are swapped



---

Algorithm steps (for 0 ≤ m ≤ 1)

1. Input two endpoints:



(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1)

2. Compute differences:



dx = x_1 - x_0,\quad dy = y_1 - y_0

3. Initialize decision parameter:



p_0 = 2dy - dx

4. Plot the first point 


5. For each x from x₀ to x₁:

If :

Choose E (East) pixel

Else:

Choose NE (North-East) pixel

Plot the selected pixel




Decision parameter meaning

p < 0 → midpoint is below the line → choose E

p ≥ 0 → midpoint is above the line → choose NE


This ensures the plotted pixel stays closest to the actual line.

Example

For points (2, 2) to (8, 5):
The algorithm then steps through x values and decides whether to increment y.


Advantages

Uses only integer arithmetic
Fast and efficient
Accurate pixel selection
Suitable for hardware implementation

Applications

Line drawing in computer graphics
Used in OpenGL, CAD systems, and game engines
Basis for circle and ellipse algorithms


In short:

Bresenham’s algorithm draws a straight line by choosing the nearest pixel at each step using integer calculations and a decision variable.

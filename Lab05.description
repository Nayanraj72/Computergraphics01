In computer graphics, 2D transformations are mathematical operations used to modify the position, size, orientation, or shape of objects in a two-dimensional plane. These transformations are commonly represented using matrix operations and are essential for rendering, animation, and modeling.

1. 2D Translation
Translation is the process of shifting an object from one position to another along the x-axis, y-axis, or both, without changing its shape or orientation.
If a point P(x, y) is translated by (tx, ty), the new position P′(x′, y′) is:
x′ = x + tx
y′ = y + ty
Translation moves the object linearly in the plane.

2. 2D Reflection
Reflection produces a mirror image of an object with respect to a reference axis or line. The size and shape of the object remain unchanged, but its orientation is reversed.
Common types of reflection:
About x-axis: y → −y
About y-axis: x → −x
About origin: (x, y) → (−x, −y)
Reflection is widely used in symmetry operations and image processing.

3. 2D Scaling
Scaling changes the size of an object either uniformly or non-uniformly along the x and y directions.
If a point P(x, y) is scaled by factors (sx, sy), the new point P′(x′, y′) is:
x′ = x × sx
y′ = y × sy
If sx = sy, uniform scaling occurs
If sx ≠ sy, non-uniform scaling occurs
Scaling can enlarge or shrink an object.

4. 2D Rotation
Rotation turns an object around a fixed point (usually the origin) by a specified angle θ in the anticlockwise direction.
For a point P(x, y) rotated by angle θ:
x′ = x cos θ − y sin θ
y′ = x sin θ + y cos θ
Rotation changes the orientation of an object while maintaining its shape and size.
